# CRUD-Form

## Description
Welcome aboard fellow developer, this is where you will find my CRUD project, which you are free to contribute to. You can contribute by submitting your own scripts, also written in Javascript, which you think would be amazing for other people to see.

### Form elements
- First Name (input) (required) (disallow digits and special characters)
- Last Name (input) (required) (disallow digits and special characters)
- Address (input) (required) (35 character limit)
- Select Date of Birth (calendar) (not required)
- Dropdown (male/female) (not required)
- Notes (textarea) (not required)

### Task Requirements 
- The form should have described validations for each field
- On submit you should show submitted data in a table below the form
- Store data in a browser's local storage (on a page refresh entered data should stay visible)
- When new data is submitted, it should get a unique identifier assigned (use auto-increment)
- The table should show the ID (auto-incremented value) of the added row first, last names
Address, Date and Gender.
- Clicking on a row element you should show a popup with Notes from the submitted form
- Table rows should have a delete button, which will delete a row from the table.
- It is allowed to use only plain Javascript (no libraries like jQuery)
- Use bootstrap to apply form and table basic styles. Styles should be responsive and look
good on Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile devices.
